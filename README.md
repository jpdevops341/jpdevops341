# 👋 Hi, I'm Jyothi Pinnika 
**Senior Platform Engineer | SRE | Kubernetes & GitOps Specialist**  

I build internal developer platforms, scale cloud-native systems, and make production boring (in a good way).  
My work lives at the intersection of **Kubernetes, GitOps, IaC, CI/CD, and Observability**.

---

## 🧠 What I Do
- Design **self-service platforms** and deployment workflows for engineering teams
- Scale **Kubernetes clusters (GKE/EKS/AKS)** with GitOps and progressive delivery
- Automate **multi-cloud infrastructure** using Terraform
- Build **resilient CI/CD** pipelines that survive production chaos
- Implement **observability (metrics, logs, tracing)** with OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Grafana
- Reduce human toil through automation, not heroism

## 🧰 Tech I Ship With

**Platform & Orchestration**  
Kubernetes (GKE, AKS, EKS) • Helm • KEDA • Istio • Argo CD (GitOps)

**Infrastructure as Code**  
Terraform • Terragrunt • CloudFormation • ARM Templates

**CI/CD & Dev Tooling**  
GitHub Actions • Argo Workflows • Cloud Build • Jenkins • Concourse/NitroDX

**Observability & Reliability**  
Prometheus • Grafana • Dynatrace • OpenTelemetry • SLO-driven monitoring

**Security**  
HashiCorp Vault • GCP Secret Manager (CSI) • Azure Key Vault • IAM/RBAC • OIDC • TLS

**Languages & Scripting**  
Python • Bash • PowerShell

## 🧩 What I Care About
- Platforms that engineers *actually want to use*
- Recovery > Reactivity  
- Automation > Documentation  
- Signals > Noise  
- Reliability > Heroics
